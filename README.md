# Treadstone 

**Rebuilding the BGA App from the ground up.**

Treadstone is the second evolution of the BGA Tour Tracker â€” a passion project I originally built to track competitive golf league stats and history. After accidentally deleting the production database (along with 60+ hours of manual data entry ðŸ˜¬), I decided to use the failure as fuel for growth.

Rather than try to salvage the old app, Iâ€™m rebuilding it from scratch using **modern, job-relevant technologies** like React, SQL, and AWS. Iâ€™ve also invited a few talented engineers from my network to help review code and test workflows â€” just like the collaboration you'd find on a real product engineering team.

Welcome to Treadstone.
